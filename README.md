This is where I learn how to do things on GitHub.


Hi there! My name is Nate, and I am just learning how to use GitHub. I will learn how to commit things to the master branch, in order to not break things so I do not get yelled at by my peers. Eventually, I will create RPDM. That is the goal. RPDM. A Garrysmod modification that has been dreamed about for ages.

Now come. Let us begin this journey... together. You monster.
